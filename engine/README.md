# ClauseChain Engine

This is the clean Python engine for the ClauseChain Round 1 submission.

It is intentionally isolated from the old Django/Next SaaS starter. The judged artifact starts here: a CLI engine that produces the required CSV and JSON outputs from legal evidence.

Current status: **P0 COMPLETE (11 Jun)**. Contracts, template-exact output (verified against the official xlsx byte-for-byte), model routing with real OpenAI/Gemini providers + fallback, swappable graph store (SQLite default / Neo4j optional), the KNOWN/NEW baseline parsed from the master dataset, fetch/OCR spike scripts, and the eval scoreboard. It does not yet perform real crawling→mapping end-to-end — that is P1 (real SG/P6 by 20 Jun).

## What This Engine Must Do

The final engine will:

1. Collect official legal sources for SG, MY, and AU.
2. Extract clean legal text from HTML/PDF/OCR sources.
3. Split law into section-aware `RuleUnit` objects.
4. Store legal structure and evidence paths in local Neo4j.
5. Retrieve candidate provisions with BM25 + dense embeddings + graph expansion.
6. Map candidates to RDTII Pillar 6 / Pillar 7 indicators.
7. Verify exact source spans, currentness, authority, and NEW/KNOWN status.
8. Export a template-exact `output.csv` and transparent `output.json`.

The current P0 dummy run proves step 8 only.

## Quick Start

Install `uv` if you do not already have it:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Run the skeleton:

```bash
cd engine
uv run pytest
uv run python run.py --country SG --pillar 6 --out outputs/demo
# --economy is an alias (matches the organizer README): 
uv run python run.py --economy Singapore --pillar 6 --out outputs/demo
```

P0 data + spike commands (run once, in this order):

```bash
# 1. Build the KNOWN/NEW baseline from the ESCAP files (master = primary, 10-Jun mail)
uv run python scripts/build_known_index.py
# 2. Grade any output.csv against the baseline (the scoreboard)
uv run python scripts/eval_vs_master.py --output outputs/demo/output.csv --economy Singapore --pillar 6
# 3. AI-1 spike: fetch the SG PDPA page (httpx first; --playwright if blocked)
uv run python scripts/spike_sg_fetch.py
# 4. AI-1 spike: prove scanned-PDF detection on the sample kit
uv run python scripts/spike_ocr_check.py
# 5. AI-2 spike: real model routing (needs OPENAI_API_KEY in .env; GEMINI_API_KEY optional)
uv run python scripts/spike_providers.py
```

Expected outputs:

```text
outputs/demo/output.csv
outputs/demo/output.json
```

If `uv` cannot write to its default cache on your machine, use:

```bash
UV_CACHE_DIR=/private/tmp/uv-cache uv run pytest
UV_CACHE_DIR=/private/tmp/uv-cache uv run python run.py --country SG --pillar 6 --out outputs/demo
```

## Output Contract

The CSV header is non-negotiable. It must stay exactly:

```text
Economy, Law Name, Law Number / Ref, Last Amended, Indicator ID, Article / Section, Discovery Tag, Location Reference, Verbatim Snippet, Mapping Rationale, Source URL, Confidence, Notes
```

The code-level source of truth is `packages/export/csv_writer.py`.

Every exported row must eventually pass verifier gates for:

- exact verbatim source span
- article/section with paragraph
- official/live source URL
- currentness / not superseded
- correct RDTII indicator
- NEW/KNOWN tag
- confidence and rationale

P0 uses dummy data, so the current verifier gates are placeholders.

## Model Routing

Do not hardcode model names inside prompts, retrieval code, or verifier code. Route through `configs/models.yaml`.

Current routing:

| Task | Model |
|---|---|
| Final dense retrieval | `text-embedding-3-large` |
| Cheap dev/testing | `text-embedding-3-small` |
| Query expansion / keyword generation | `gpt-5.4-nano` or Gemini |
| Candidate reranking | `gpt-5.4-nano` first; `gpt-5.4-mini` for hard cases |
| Final legal mapping / rationale | `gpt-5.4-mini` / Gemini high reasoning |
| Embedding fallback experiment | `gemini-embedding-001` |

Rule: embeddings use embedding models, not chat/reasoning models.

## Environment

Copy the example env file when real providers are wired:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Important variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=
```

The P0 dummy run does not require API keys or Neo4j.

## Legal evidence graph (SQLite default, Neo4j optional)

**Final decision (GraphRAG Strategy §12):** the graph is a *data model* behind the
swappable `GraphStore` interface — same nodes/edges either way:

- economies, instruments, versions, sections, provisions, source spans,
  indicators, candidate findings, verified findings

Backends:

| Backend | When | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| `sqlite` (**default**) | The judged path. Zero extra services — judges run pip-only. | none (`data/graph.db` auto-created) |
| `neo4j` (optional) | Live-demo graph view + Cypher answers in the interview. | set `GRAPH_BACKEND=neo4j` + the `NEO4J_*` vars |

The swap is one env var — the same trick as the LLM/OCR swap, and demoed the same way.
`packages/graph/schema.cypher` defines the Neo4j constraints; `packages/graph/sqlite_graph.py`
is the default store. The dummy run works with no graph service at all.

## Team Responsibilities

Lead:

- Keep `run.py` runnable.
- Own schemas, orchestrator, CSV/JSON output, and integration.
- Reject changes that break the dummy run or output contract.

AI-1:

- Build connectors and extraction.
- First target: SG official HTML source.
- Next target: MY scanned/OCR source.
- Return `SourceDocument` and `ExtractedPage` objects only.

AI-2:

- Build retrieval, embeddings, graph expansion, reranking, predicate extraction, RDTII mapping, and verifier gates.
- Return `RuleUnit`, `CandidateFinding`, `MappedFinding`, and `GateResult` objects.
- Keep all model calls behind provider interfaces.

Legal:

- Own indicator meaning, gold rows, known provisions, and final mapping correctness.
- Provide exact quotes, article/section, source URL, expected indicator, and NEW/KNOWN label.

## Development Rules

- No UI work until the CLI produces real SG/P6 output.
- No direct model calls outside provider modules.
- No CSV column changes without updating tests and leadership approval.
- No LLM-generated graph edge without source-span verification.
- No final export row without a source URL and verbatim snippet.
- Keep old `backend/`, `frontend/`, and `agentic-rag-knowledge-graph/` untouched unless explicitly assigned.

## Test Commands

Run all tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run the public skeleton command:

```bash
uv run python run.py --country SG --pillar 6 --out outputs/demo
```

Inspect output:

```bash
cat outputs/demo/output.csv
cat outputs/demo/output.json
```

## Next Engineering Milestones

P0 complete when: ✅ DONE (11 Jun)

- [x] tests pass (16)
- [x] dummy command writes CSV + JSON (header verified against the official template file)
- [x] schemas are stable enough for team work
- [x] each owner knows which objects they must return
- [x] rubric YAMLs encode the official scoring criteria (incl. P7 polarity)
- [x] KNOWN baseline built from the master DB (306 article refs parsed from Impact prose)
- [x] graph store swappable (sqlite default / neo4j optional)
- [x] eval scoreboard runs (`scripts/eval_vs_master.py`)
- [ ] HUMAN VERIFY: API-key spike (`scripts/spike_providers.py`) + SG fetch spike — need keys/network

P1 target:

```bash
uv run python run.py --country SG --pillar 6 --out outputs/sg-p6
```

That command should produce real Singapore Pillar 6 output from official source data, with no UI dependency.
